Soda Pop
Coding Challenge Description:
The user will enter an ending number, and a range of numbers starting with 1 up to the number given by the user will be tested to see if they are divisible by ‘3’, if they are, the numbers divisible by ‘3’ will be replaced by the word “Soda”, the numbers divisible by ‘5’, will be replaced by the word “Pop”, and the numbers that are divisible by both ‘3’ and ‘5’, will be replaced by the phrase “Soda Pop”. Then the app uses the remaining numbers up to the user given ending number and determines which ones are even and which ones are odd, displaying the even numbers in green and the odd numbers, along with the Soda Pop words in gray.
